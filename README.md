# Exam Scheduling System

## This is my first project of the data structure course about linked lists, you can find the assignment details in doc/AssignmentDescription.pdf

You can download this repo and directly use it on the docker environment, just download it, open the folder in vscode and click reopen in container when the docker is running on your computer.

You can use the commands "make clean", "make build" and "make run" respectively.

If you want the test the codes, first you should use the command 
### "git clone https://github.com/nemequ/munit.git lib/munit"

after that you can use "make tests" command.
